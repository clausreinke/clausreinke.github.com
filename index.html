My web home is rather distributed these days, so this is
part sites map, part home page:
</div>

<div class="site">
<em><a href="projects.html">Recent projects</a></em> are likely to appear on <a
href="https://github.com/clausreinke">my Github account</a>.
Currently, these tend to be <em>Javascript projects</em> or
<em>Vim support for Javascript developers</em>.
</div>

<div class="site" id="typescript-tools">
I develop <strong><a
href="https://github.com/clausreinke/typescript-tools">typescript-tools</a></strong>, a
commandline server and Vim plugin for using <a
href="http://www.typescriptlang.org/">TypeScript</a> Language Services
(<em>types, jump-to-definition, completion, compiler errors</em>).
</div>

<div class="site" id="tern">
I have been helping out with the <a
href="https://github.com/marijnh/tern_for_vim">Vim plugin</a> for <a
href="https://github.com/marijnh/tern">Tern</a>, a Javascript analyser for
intelligent Javascript editing support (<em>types, jump-to-definition, completion,
documentation lookup, find-references, renaming</em>).
</div>

<div class="site" id="estr">
Before collaborating on Tern, I used to focus on my own Javascript tooling <strong><a
href="https://github.com/clausreinke/estr">estr</a></strong> (<em>code
traversal, navigation, transformation</em>;
<a href="http://clausreinke.github.com/estr">online demo</a>).
</div>

<div class="site" id="js-tools">
I help to manage <strong><a
href="http://groups.google.com/group/js-tools/about">js-tools</a></strong>, the
mailing list for Javascript tool developers, and curate the <strong><a
href="http://clausreinke.github.com/js-tools/resources.html">js-tools resources</a></strong>.
</div>

<div class="site" id="blog">
I do have <a href="http://libraryinstitute.wordpress.com/">a blog</a>,
but tend to be more active in mailing lists, so my blog is not as busy
as it should be.
</div>

<div class="site" id="haskell">
If you are looking for my old <em>Haskell projects</em>, you'll find most of them via
<a href="http://community.haskell.org/~claus/">my Haskell Community
page</a>. I also have a <a

<div class="site" id="youtube">
Occasionally, I have recorded <a

projects</a>, such as my <a

<p>
<strong>I am a software toolsmith</strong>. I enjoy writing software that helps
turning computers into useful tools, with a particular focus on writing tools
for other software developers - from development tools all the way to
programming languages. I have worked with Javascript/TypeScript, Haskell, and
lots of other programming languages, starting from way before there was a web.
</p>
<p>
My interests evolve around <em>(declarative) programming languages</em>:
<strong>language design and implementation</strong>, <strong>tool
development</strong>, and <strong>programming techniques</strong>.  Having
looked into most of the major programming paradigms, I've more or less settled
on a <em>combination of functional and concurrent programming</em> as the main
paradigms I like to see supported well, directly in the language design.
Occasionally, logic and object-oriented programming also come in handy as
programming paradigms, but language designs built solely around these two tend
to be less helpful for general programming.
</p>
<!--
<p>
If this sounds odd to you, consider <em>embedded domain-specific languages
and language support for building abstractions</em>: functional abstraction
seems to do very well for the latter, making functional languages good
hosts for embedded-DSL-based development. Also, object-oriented and
logic programming can be supported reasonably well as embedded DSLs,
while concurrent programming needs language support, and functional
programming without good functional abstraction is just painful.
</p>
-->
<p>
On a purely technical basis, I have been tempted to stick with <em>Haskell</em>,
helping to address its remaining shortcomings. The problem is that this
ignores social rationales, in particular, what I would call momentum: so
many developers have been using Java and Php that their needs have
driven the development of frameworks and tools to ease some of the
technical disadvantages of the language (the proliferation of frameworks and
complexity of tools have their own disadvantages). And there is a storm
brewing here, with <em>Javascript</em> having the potential to reach more
developers than Java or Php ever had -- and its momentum is building rapidly.
</p>
<p>
Javascript is not without problems, but it is surprising what one can achieve
by focussing on the good parts of the language: out of the box, it supports
functional, object-oriented, and aspect-oriented programming. Its main
problems are a syntax and APIs that hamper extensive use of functional
programming (instead, it has inherited a focus on assignment, statement blocks
and built-in control structures), semantics and APIs that hamper equational
reasoning, and an inertia (the flip side of momentum) that hampers attempts to
change the language (none of which are helpful when looking at concurrency
support; even functional programming improvements sometimes encounter
resistance).
</p>
<p>
It remains to be seen what can be done in terms of improving the Javascript
language or scaffolding it with tool support (<a
href="http://clausreinke.github.com/js-tools/resources.html#group:language-extensions">ES6
modules and classes, as well as types can be supported by transpilers</a>, so
2013 will see many of these features used in anger; sadly, the spec has lagged
behind implementations, so the two are sometimes out of sync). This is
where I would like to focus my efforts in the immediate future. <strong>If
you are looking for a Javascript coder and tool developer with my <a
href="http://libraryinstitute.wordpress.com/about/">background</a> and
interests, please <a href="https://github.com/clausreinke">get in touch</a></strong>. If
you are developing Javascript tools yourself, or want to stay up to date in
that area, you want to check out our new <a
