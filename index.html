<strong>I am a software toolsmith</strong>. I enjoy writing software that helps
turning computers into useful tools, with a particular focus on writing tools
for other software developers - from development tools all the way to
programming languages. I have worked with Javascript/TypeScript (~4yrs/2yrs),
Haskell (~14yrs), and more other programming languages than I can remember
(past intensively used languages include C ~8yrs, Java, Perl, ...; on smaller
scale, I also used languages like Prolog, Lisp, Erlang, ...), starting from way
before there was a web (my first languages were Homecomputer Basic and Z80
Assembly). I have been on the web since before the internet archive started,
though I've mostly seen it more as a way to distribute content than as something
to play around with (so please pardon my lack of fancy design/animations/etc:-).
</p>
<p>
My <a href="projects.html">recent projects</a> tend to be <em>Javascript
projects</em> or <em>Vim support for Javascript and TypeScript developers</em>
or WebApp-related technology experiments.  Their sources are likely to appear
on my Github account.
</p>
<p>
My interests evolve around <em>(declarative) programming languages</em>:
<strong>language design and implementation</strong>, <strong>tool
development</strong>, and <strong>programming techniques</strong>.  Having
looked into most of the major programming paradigms, I've more or less settled
on a <em>combination of functional and concurrent programming</em> as the main
paradigms I like to see supported well, directly in the language design.
Logic and object-oriented programming also come in handy as
programming paradigms, but language designs built solely around these two tend
to be less helpful for general programming.
</p>
<p>
On a purely technical basis, I have been tempted to stick with <em>Haskell</em>,
helping to address its remaining shortcomings. The main reasons for considering
Javascript were social in nature, in particular, what I would call momentum:
<em>Javascript</em> had the potential to reach more developers and devices --
which has been attracting ideas, tools, experiments, programmer and tool builder
activity.
</p>
<p>
Javascript is not without problems, but it is surprising what one can achieve
by focussing on the good parts of the language: out of the box, it supports
functional, object-oriented, and aspect-oriented programming. Its main
problems are syntax, semantics and APIs that hamper extensive use of functional
programming or equational reasoning (instead, it has inherited a focus on
side-effects, statement blocks and built-in control structures), and an inertia
(the flip side of momentum) that hampers and occasionally misdirects attempts
to change the language (none of which are helpful when looking at concurrency
support; even functional programming improvements sometimes encounter
resistance).
It remains to be seen what can be done in terms of improving the Javascript
experience by scaffolding it with tool support.
