<p>
My interests evolve around <strong>(declarative) programming
languages</strong>: <em>language design and implementation</em>,
<em>tool development</em>, and <em>programming techniques</em>.  Having
looked into most of the major programming paradigms, I've more or less
settled on a combination of functional and concurrent programming as the
main paradigms I like to see supported well, directly in the language
design. Occasionally, logic and object-oriented programming also come in
handy as programming paradigms, but language designs built solely around
these two tend to be less helpful for general programming.
</p>
<p>
If this sounds odd to you, consider embedded domain-specific languages
and language support for building abstractions: functional abstraction
seems to do very well for the latter, making functional languages good
hosts for embedded-DSL-based development. Also, object-oriented and
logic programming can be supported reasonably well as embedded DSLs,
while concurrent programming needs language support, and functional
programming without good functional abstraction is just painful.
</p>
<p>
On a purely technical basis, I have been tempted to stick with Haskell,
helping to address its remaining shortcomings. The problem is that this
ignores social rationales, in particular, what I would call momentum: so
many developers have been using Java and Php that their needs have
driven the development of frameworks and tools to ease some of the
technical disadvantages of the language (the proliferation of frameworks
has its own disadvantages, but I am sometimes envious of Java's Eclipse
community). However, there is a storm brewing here, with Javascript
having the potential to reach more developers than Java or Php ever had
-- and its momentum is building rapidly. Javascript is not without
problems, but it is surprising what one can achieve by focussing on the
good parts of the language.
</p>
<p>
It remains to be seen what can be done in terms of improving or
scaffolding the Javascript language, but this is where I would like to
focus my efforts in the immediate future. So, if you are looking for a
Javascript coder with my <a
href="http://libraryinstitute.wordpress.com/about/">background</a> and
interests, please <a href="https://github.com/clausreinke">get in
touch</a>.  </p>

My web home is rather distributed these days, so this is
currently more of a sites map than a home page:

<div id="sites">

<div class="site">
<em>Recent projects</em> are likely to appear on <a
href="https://github.com/clausreinke">my Github account</a>.
This is going to include my <em>Javascript projects</em>.
</div>

<div class="site" id="haskell">
If you are looking for my <em>Haskell projects</em>, you'll find most of them via
<a href="http://community.haskell.org/~claus/">my Haskell Community
page</a>. I also have a <a
href="http://www.haskellers.com/user/claus/">Haskellers profile</a>.
</div>

<div class="site" id="blog">
I do have <a href="http://libraryinstitute.wordpress.com/">a blog</a>,
but tend to be more active in mailing lists, so my blog is not as busy
as it should be.  Given that twitter/irc-based folks no longer have the
patience to read longer emails, that might change;-)
</div>

<div class="site" id="youtube">
Occasionally, I have recorded <a
href="http://www.youtube.com/user/whycombinator">screencasts of my
projects</a>, such as my <a
href="http://projects.haskell.org/haskellmode-vim/screencasts.html">Haskell
mode plugins for Vim</a>, our <a

<div class="site" id="publications">
Many of my older <a

and <a href="http://community.haskell.org/~claus/talks/">talks</a>
are available online, as well.
