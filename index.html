My web home is rather distributed these days, so this is
currently more of a sites map than a home page:
</div>

<div class="site">
<em>Recent projects</em> are likely to appear on <a
href="https://github.com/clausreinke">my Github account</a>.
This is going to include my <em>Javascript projects</em>.
</div>

<div class="site" id="haskell">
If you are looking for my <em>Haskell projects</em>, you'll find most of them via
<a href="http://community.haskell.org/~claus/">my Haskell Community
page</a>. I also have a <a
href="http://www.haskellers.com/user/claus/">Haskellers profile</a>.
</div>

<div class="site" id="blog">
I do have <a href="http://libraryinstitute.wordpress.com/">a blog</a>,
but tend to be more active in mailing lists, so my blog is not as busy
as it should be.  Given that twitter/irc-based folks no longer have the
patience to read longer emails, that might change;-)
</div>

<div class="site" id="youtube">
Occasionally, I have recorded <a
href="http://www.youtube.com/user/whycombinator">screencasts of my
projects</a>, such as my <a
href="http://projects.haskell.org/haskellmode-vim/screencasts.html">Haskell
mode plugins for Vim</a>, our <a
href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4I7VZV7elnY">Haskell Refactorer
HaRe</a>, or a <a

<div class="site" id="publications">
Many of my older <a

and <a href="http://community.haskell.org/~claus/talks/">talks</a>
are available online, as well.
</div>

<div class="site" id="js-tools">
I help managing <a
href="http://groups.google.com/group/js-tools/about">js-tools</a>, the new
mailing list for Javascript tool developers, and its <a

<article id="interests">
<p>
My interests evolve around <strong>(declarative) programming
languages</strong>: <em>language design and implementation</em>,
<em>tool development</em>, and <em>programming techniques</em>.  Having
looked into most of the major programming paradigms, I've more or less
settled on a <em>combination of functional and concurrent programming</em> as
the main paradigms I like to see supported well, directly in the language
design. Occasionally, logic and object-oriented programming also come in
handy as programming paradigms, but language designs built solely around
these two tend to be less helpful for general programming.
</p>
<p>
If this sounds odd to you, consider <em>embedded domain-specific languages
and language support for building abstractions</em>: functional abstraction
seems to do very well for the latter, making functional languages good
hosts for embedded-DSL-based development. Also, object-oriented and
logic programming can be supported reasonably well as embedded DSLs,
while concurrent programming needs language support, and functional
programming without good functional abstraction is just painful.
</p>
<p>
On a purely technical basis, I have been tempted to stick with <em>Haskell</em>,
helping to address its remaining shortcomings. The problem is that this
ignores social rationales, in particular, what I would call momentum: so
many developers have been using Java and Php that their needs have
driven the development of frameworks and tools to ease some of the
technical disadvantages of the language (the proliferation of frameworks
has its own disadvantages, but I am sometimes envious of Java's Eclipse
community). However, there is a storm brewing here, with <em>Javascript</em>
having the potential to reach more developers than Java or Php ever had
-- and its momentum is building rapidly.
</p>
<p>
Javascript is not without problems, but it is surprising what one can achieve
by focussing on the good parts of the language: out of the box, it supports
functional, object-oriented, and aspect-oriented programming. Its main
problems are a syntax and APIs that hamper extensive use of functional
programming, semantics and APIs that hamper equational reasoning, and an
inertia (the flip side of momentum) that hampers attempts to change the
language (none of which are helpful when looking at concurrency support).
</p>
<p>
It remains to be seen what can be done in terms of improving the Javascript
language or scaffolding it with tool support, but this is where I would like to
focus my efforts in the immediate future. So, if you are looking for a
Javascript coder and tool developer with my <a
href="http://libraryinstitute.wordpress.com/about/">background</a> and
interests, please <a href="https://github.com/clausreinke">get in
touch</a>. If you are developing Javascript tools yourself, or want to stay up
to date in that area, you want to check out our new <a
href="http://groups.google.com/group/js-tools/about">js-tools</a> group.
