<h3>Things I've done</h3>
<p>
Among other things, I have
<ul>
<li>...</li>
<li>developed Vim plugins and other tools to support TypeScript, JavaScript, and Haskell developers</li>
<li>discovered that CPN (Coloured Petri Nets) and CHR (Constraint-Handling Rules) are two sides of the same coin</li>
<li>initiated and completed (with two colleagues) an EPSRC-funded project to develop HaRe, the Haskell Refactorer</li>
<li>initiated and edited the first biannual Haskell Communities and Activities Reports</li>
<li>developed a tool to visualize demand and data-flow in Haskell program execution (visualisation via Java Applet)</li>
<li>developed a language and implementations to describe 3d structures and animations declaratively, re-interpreting some functional reactive programming ideas (visualisation initially via VRML'97+ECMAScript, later via OpenGL)</li>
<li>implemented Haskell-Coloured Petri Nets by embedding them into Haskell</li>
<li>taught a 'Compilers' course to 2nd year BSc CS students</li>
<li>called Java code from Haskell, via two still-in-development native interfaces..</li>
<li>studied first-class module systems and other ways of program-controlled modularity inside a functional language, long before that became a topic in JS</li>
<li>taught advanced project courses on 'System Modeling with Petri Nets' to MSc CS students</li>
<li>worked on integrating logic programming ideas into a functional programming language</li>
</ul>
